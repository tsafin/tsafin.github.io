<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
    I don't know how you, but I do use frequently the CSS/JavaScript debugger in the browser, and it bothers me a lot when I see situations, sites, pages where I'm unable to use it easily. Blogspot page preview is the such case - they intercept click events
    on the pages while showing me preview page, and as a side effect of this interception Chrome debugging tools are unable to show me information about selected object (because click is not real click here).<br />If you open preview page and invoke
    debugger tools, CSS inspector (Ctrl+Shift+I), and try to select the reading area you will probably fail here...<br />
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
        <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WEAdEWPSWaQ/U0bsP-1CvmI/AAAAAAAAQro/dAd17SpRPFM/s1600/image1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WEAdEWPSWaQ/U0bsP-1CvmI/AAAAAAAAQro/dAd17SpRPFM/s1600/image1.png" height="228" width="320" /></a>
    </div>You will probably select the object which cover whole reading pane, and which "coincidentally" has CSS class "Blogger-clickTrap". Taking into account the intention of this div box has been added there I prefer to get rid of it. Yes, just delete this
    node in the DOM tree in the left:<br />
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

    </div><br />Since now on you have 2 nice side effects:<br /><br />
    <ul style="text-align: left;">
        <li>CSS debugger object selector is able to work again;</li>
        <li>and click events are properly working for all JavaScript on the page.</li>
    </ul>
    <div>That's the desired effect we wanted to return.</div>
</div>
